# Contributing to advent-of-code-charts

This is only a tiny side-project, so let's keep it simple.
Here's what you need to know:

- First and foremost: be nice, open, welcoming, and inclusive to eachother!
- This is a fun side-project made by an enthusiast. It's not endorsed by- or affiliated with (the creator of) Advent of Code (the name, the project, the puzzles: they're Eric Wastl's) - keep that in mind when contributing.
- I accept PRs and welcome issue reports. For big changes open an issue first please, so we can discuss it before loads of efforts are put in.

For info on how to build, run, and debug things: check out the readme.
